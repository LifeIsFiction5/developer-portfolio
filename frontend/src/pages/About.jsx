        Hey, I'm Jake — a full-stack developer who loves building things that make people say “Whoa.” I work primarily with React, Spring Boot, and MySQL, and I’m passionate about clean UI and thoughtful backend logic.

      <p>
        I got my start in coding with LaunchCode in 2024.  In the full stack web development program, I learned the fundamentals of web development, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python. I also gained experience with frameworks like React and Flask, as well as databases like MySQL and MongoDB.

        The culmination of my learning at LaunchCode ended with development of my Full Stack application, MuseMatch!  Please check it out through my projects page.  Bear in mind, it's still under development, but I am proud of the progress I've made so far.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I'm not coding, I'm probably training my corgi Finn, playing music, or sketching out ideas for my next project.
